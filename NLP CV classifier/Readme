Resume/CV classifier using NLP

This repository consists of sourcecode of the project resume/cv classifier using NLP, where I have used opensource NLP package spacy to vectorize my text data and fitted 
a classification model to predict/classify the job role of the candidate. 

1) NLP_resumeclassifier.ipynb --> file contains the main code where our dataset has been cleaned and feature extraction is done.
2) Resume_parser_drivercode.ipynb --> This code is used for extracting contents from any pdf/docx file. In our case it is resume and it returns the contents as string.
3) UpdatedResumeDataSet.csv --> dataset used for this project
4) resumedata.txt --> Output of resumeparser drivercode program.
